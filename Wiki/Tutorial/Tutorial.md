# Microcontroller Tutorial for Microcontroller-Only And Computer-Controlled Programs

This is the entry point for setting up microcontroller.
You must start here regardless you choose microcontroller-only or computer-controlled programs.

## Before you Continue

Before you begin, make sure you meet all of the following requirements:
1. **You have a computer.** This used to go without saying, but it's becoming apparent that many people do not have computers anymore and only have phones or tablets. You need to have a Windows, macOS or Linux laptop/desktop computer (or a high-end Windows tablet) that you can install software on it.
2. If you intend to do Computer-Control programs, you MUST be running a sufficiently powerful computer. (no low-end laptops or notebooks)

*In the past, we supported building microcontroller-only .hex files for Mac and Linux . But this was dropped due to lack of developer support. While we still have instructions for Mac and Linux, they may be out-of-date and may no longer work. We do not recommend going this route unless you are computer-saavy and are willing to debug shell scripts.*

## Next Steps

All of our programs need at least one microcontroller. You need to select a microcontroller model.

If you are a beginner of using microcontroller or never heard of it before,
we **strongly recommend** choosing an [Arduino Leonardo Board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0786LJQ8K).

If you have a degree in electrical engineering or have extensive experience in microcontrollers and would like more options, feel free to choose at your own discretion.
