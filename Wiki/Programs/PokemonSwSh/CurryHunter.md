The microcontroller and computer-control versions of this program are functionally identical.


## Program Description

This program will endlessly cook curry, and it will catch the Pokémon coming to your camp. It doesn't stop on a shiny, so you will need to check all the Pokémon in your boxes once you stop the program.

An entire run (cooking curry + attracting the Pokémon) takes around 2 mins 30 seconds. With Charizard class curry, you are supposed to have a 1 in 4 chance of getting a curry encounter (assuming you follow the Setup regarding your team). In addition to that, curry encounters are really likely to be full odds. Thus, the average time of a curry hunt is around 28 days.

> Disclaimer : due to the fact that the program is the same for all the locations, it may not attract the curry Pokémon all the time

**Do not Cook curry in the wild area. You can't get any curry Pokémon to spawn in the wild area.**


### Setup of Settings

This program blindly cooks curry forever. With the right berries and ingredients, it will always cook a Charizard class curry, maximizing your odds of getting an encounter. Follow the steps above for a guaranteed Charizard class curry.

1. Stock up on rare berries. I recommand enigma, micle, custap, jaboca and rowap since they can be farmed from berry trees using the [**DateSpam-BerryFarmer**](DateSpam-BerryFarmer.md) program. Three of them, the micle, jaboca and rowap berry, can be farmed in the same tree in the giant's bed, so this is a really good spot to farm them. You can use starf berry if you want, but it's harder to farm.
2. Buy a lot of rare ingredients. The ones you want to buy are the one you can get from sellers for $2,200, they are Smoke-Poke Tail, Boiled Egg, Fruit Bunch and Moomoo Cheese. The seller near the dojo in the Isle of Armor DLC sell all of them. If he doesn't have them, skipping a day will change the articles he sells you. Large Leek and Fancy Apple can also be used, but they are more annoying to farm.

To cook a Charizard class curry, the bot will use one ingredient and two berries.

In addition to that, you will need a specific party, to make sure you will be able to attract the curry Pokémon. 

1. A party of small and slow Pokémon such as Meltan, Snom is **highly** recommanded. This is to make sure your Pokémon don't come to you too quickly, giving you the time to attract the curry Pokémon. 
2. You want a full party of 6 Pokémon. This boosts the odds of getting a Pokémon coming to your camp after cooking curry.
3. You want all of your party Pokémon to have max friendship and max sociability. This also boosts the odds of getting a Pokémon coming to your camp after cooking curry. 

To know if 2 Pokémon maxed out their sociability, you have to talk to both in the camp. The only message showing that the sociability of both Pokémon is maxed is the following "Pokémon A and Pokémon B seem to be best friends !".

Last but not least, you will need some balls to catch the Pokémon coming to your camp. These Pokémon can only be caught in Poké ball, Great ball or Ultra ball. If you don't have any of these 3 balls, you won't get any Pokémon spawning in your camp. So just buying 999 of your favorite ball out of these the 3 listed above.

Now, you are ready to cook curry.


### About Friendship and Sociability:

If you don't feel like bothering with increasing both friendship and sociability, note that cooking curry with your curry hunting team will increase both their friendship and their sociability. But if you reset after each session to save berries and ingredients, you are going to have to increase these at the beginning of each session, and this will actually affect the speed of your hunt. As this is already quite a long hunt, it is **highly** recommanded to max both friendship and sociability. At the time of writing, cooking curry is the only known method to increase your Pokémon's sociability.


### Instructions

1. You need to have cook at least one curry before using the program. This is because you have several additional text boxes the first time you cook curry.
2. Casual mode is off.
3. Your text speed must be set to fast.
4. The "Send to Boxes" option must be set to "Automatic".
5. Make sure to favorite as many rare ingredients and rare berries as possible. That way, the program can run for a really long time.
6. Your character needs to be in the curry camp, with the curry menu closed.
7. Start the program in the [Change Grip/Order Menu](/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/ChangeGripOrderMenu.md).


## Options

This program has no program-specific configuration options yet.

Most of the options are self-explanatory.

## Troubleshooting

Very rarely, your Pokémon can give you a berry or an ingredient. This can cause the program to keep talking to the Pokémon during an entire cooking curry routine, but the program will recover from that.

The program was created based on Glimwood Tangle's encounters. As each Pokémon behave in a different way, this program may or may not work on other locations. Some Pokémon, such as Grubbin, Blipbug, Caterpie, are really slow, and will require to slow down the program. Some others, like Stunfisk, are low on the ground, and even though the program should attract them most of the time, it will not get them 100% of the time. Different implementations will soon be released to allow the program to adapt to the location.
