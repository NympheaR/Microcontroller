- **Computer Control:** [Egg Fetcher](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/ComputerControl/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/PokemonBDSP/EggFetcher.md)

The microcontroller and computer-control versions of this program are functionally identical.

## Program Description

Fetch eggs into your boxes without hatching them.

This program is used with [EggHatcher](EggHatcher.md) to fetch and hatch eggs. Thus you first fetch a bunch of eggs with EggFetcher, then you hatch them with EggHatcher.


### Setup of Settings

1. Text Speed: Fast
2. The "Send to Boxes" option must be set to "Automatic".
3. The parents are already deposited at the daycare center.

**Strongly Recommended:**
- Masuda Method: The Pok√©mon in the daycare are of different languages.
- Have the Oval Charm.
- Have the Shiny Charm.

### Instructions

1. Your party is full and none are eggs.
2. You are on your bike and in high gear.
3. You have the bike registered. (and the Dpad shortcut option correctly selected in the program)
4. You have at least 2 things registered for shortcuts. (so that pressing + brings up the menu)
5. Stand in the following location.
6. Start the program in the [Change Grip/Order Menu](/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/ChangeGripOrderMenu.md).

## Options

### Go Home when Done:

After the program finishes, go to the Switch Home to idle.

### Fetch Attempts:

Make this many attempts to fetch an egg. The only reason to set this option is to avoid over-fetching of eggs and clogging up all your boxes.

### Travel Time per Fetch:

Spin on your bike for this long before attempting to fetch another egg.
