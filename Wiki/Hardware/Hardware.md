# Hardware - Microcontroller-Only and Computer-Controlled Programs

This section covers how to purchase various hardware for automation programs.

## Microcontroller Hardware

If you are a beginner of using microcontroller or never heard of it before,
we **strongly recommend** choosing an **Arduino Leonardo Board**.

If you have a degree in electrical engineering or have extensive experience in microcontrollers and would like more options, feel free to choose at your own discretion.

- [Arduino Leonardo (beginner-friendly)](../Hardware/ArduinoLeonardo.md)
- [Teensy 2.0 and Teensy++ 2.0](../Hardware/Teensy2.md)
- [Pro Micro](../Hardware/ProMicro.md)
- [Arduino Uno R3  (not recommended)](../Hardware/ArduinoUnoR3.md)

## Additional Hardware for Computer-Controlled Programs

If you only need microcontroller-only programs, skip this section.

### Serial Hardware

In order to use computer-control programs, your computer needs to be able to control your game console (duh!).

The way we do it is by using a [serial connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port) to connect the microcontroller to the computer. This allows the computer to take control of your game console.

Purchase the serial hardware listed in each microcontroller's page in [**Microcontroller Hardware**](#microcontroller-hardware) section.

### Video Hardware

Most computer-controlled programs need to see the screen! So a video capture card is also needed. See the [capture card purchase guide](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/ComputerControl/blob/master/Wiki/Hardware/VideoHardware.md).

You also need a HDMI cable to connect video capture card to the Switch dock.
